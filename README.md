# 🕵️‍♂️ Task 2 – Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

This repository contains my work for **Task 2 of the Future Interns Cyber Security Internship**.  
The focus of this project is on **security log analysis, threat detection, and incident response** using real-world log samples and comprehensive incident handling procedures.

---

## 📌 Task Overview
- Objective: **Analyze security logs** to detect, classify, and respond to various types of cyber threats and malware activity, including end-to-end incident response communication.
- Deliverable: A detailed **Incident Response Report** supported by evidence files, dashboards, classification results, and professional email communications.

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- **Security Log Analysis Tools:** Splunk Cloud (trial)
- **Incident Response:** Email communication protocols
- **Report Generation:** Overleaf (LaTeX)

## 📋 Incident Response Workflow
1. **Log Ingestion** → Splunk Cloud implementation
2. **Threat Detection** → SPL query development
3. **Alert Classification** → Severity-based alert system
4. **Dashboard Creation** → Real-time visualization
5. **Communication** → Professional email protocols
6. **Reporting** → Comprehensive incident documentation
